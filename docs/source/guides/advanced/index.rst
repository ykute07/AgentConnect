.. Customizing Agents
.. ------------------
.. :doc:`customizing_agents`

.. Dive deep into agent internals. Learn how to add custom capabilities, integrate unique tools, implement advanced memory systems, configure payment features, and modify the core agent processing loop. This section also covers advanced rate limiting and interaction control, including token usage tracking, cooldowns, and conversation statistics.

.. Customizing the Communication Hub
.. ---------------------------------
.. :doc:`customizing_hub`

.. Tailor the heart of agent interaction. Add custom message handlers, implement event hooks, or modify message routing logic. (Note: Pluggable backends like Redis are not currently supported at the framework level.)

.. Customizing the Registry & Discovery
.. ------------------------------------
.. :doc:`customizing_registry`

.. Control how agents find each other. Configure the agent registration process, customize capability discovery algorithms, and manage agent identity verification and registration flows.

.. Customizing AI Providers
.. ------------------------
.. :doc:`customizing_providers`

.. Extend language model support. Add new providers beyond the defaults, configure specific model parameters (temperature, top_p, etc.), and manage advanced credential handling.

.. Customizing Payment Integration
.. -------------------------------
.. :doc:`customizing_payments`

.. Fine-tune the agent economy. Configure advanced payment settings, customize blockchain network support, implement custom payment logic, and manage wallets directly. (See the guide for details on supported networks.)

.. Customizing Callbacks & Monitoring
.. ----------------------------------
.. :doc:`customizing_callbacks`

.. Enhance observability and integration. Implement custom callbacks for detailed monitoring, specialized logging, or triggering external systems like advanced LangSmith features.

.. Customizing Logging
.. -------------------
.. :doc:`customizing_logging`

.. Configure detailed system logging. Set up advanced logging handlers, define custom log formats, and control logging levels for different components.

.. Customizing Prompts & Workflows
.. -------------------------------
.. :doc:`customizing_prompts`

.. Shape agent reasoning. Extend or modify core agent prompts, design complex interaction workflows, and create templates for specialized tasks.

.. Advanced CLI Usage
.. ------------------
.. :doc:`advanced_cli`

.. Master the command line. Explore advanced CLI arguments for fine-grained control over agent behavior, hub configurations, and framework settings.

.. .. note::
..    These guides assume familiarity with the core concepts of AgentConnect. For foundational knowledge, please refer to the :doc:`../../quickstart` section. Each guide provides practical examples and best practices.
