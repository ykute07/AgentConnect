Secure Agent Communication
=========================

In a decentralized agent framework like AgentConnect, where autonomous agents interact and exchange information, ensuring secure communication is critical. This guide explains how AgentConnect automatically handles message signing and verification to maintain authenticity and integrity across agent interactions.

Why Security Matters
------------------

When independent agents communicate, two critical security aspects must be addressed:

1. **Authenticity**: Ensuring messages truly come from their claimed sender
2. **Integrity**: Confirming messages haven't been altered during transmission

Without these guarantees, malicious entities could impersonate agents or modify message content, potentially compromising the entire system. AgentConnect provides built-in mechanisms to handle these security concerns automatically.

The Role of AgentIdentity
------------------------

At the core of AgentConnect's security model is the :class:`AgentIdentity <agentconnect.core.types.AgentIdentity>` class. Each agent in the system has its own identity that:

- Contains cryptographic key pairs (public/private)
- Enables secure signing and verification of messages
- Uniquely identifies the agent in the network

When creating any agent, you must provide an identity:

.. code-block:: python

    from agentconnect.core.types import AgentIdentity
    from agentconnect.agents import AIAgent
    
    # Create a new identity with a fresh key pair
    agent_identity = AgentIdentity.create_key_based()
    
    # Assign the identity when initializing the agent
    agent = AIAgent(
        agent_id="secure-agent-001",
        name="Secure Assistant",
        identity=agent_identity,  # Identity provides security capabilities
        # ... other parameters
    )

The ``create_key_based()`` method generates a secure RSA key pair:

- The **private key** allows the agent to sign messages (proving authorship)
- The **public key** allows others to verify the signature (confirming authenticity)

For more details on how identity fits into the overall framework, see the :doc:`core_concepts` guide.

Automatic Message Signing
-----------------------

When an agent sends a message through AgentConnect, the framework automatically handles message signing:

1. The message is created using the sender's identity
2. The ``Message.create()`` method internally calls the identity's signing function  
3. The sender's private key cryptographically signs the message content
4. The signature is attached to the message

.. code-block:: python

    # This happens automatically when messages are created
    message = Message.create(
        sender_id=agent.agent_id,
        receiver_id=target_agent.agent_id,
        content="Hello, this is a secure message",
        sender_identity=agent.identity,  # Used for signing
        message_type=MessageType.TEXT
    )
    
    # At this point, the message already contains a cryptographic signature

The ``CommunicationHub`` ensures that all messages flowing through the system have valid signatures before routing them to their destination.

Automatic Message Verification
---------------------------

When an agent receives a message, the framework automatically verifies its authenticity:

1. The ``CommunicationHub`` intercepts the message during routing
2. It extracts the sender's public key from the attached identity
3. It verifies the signature against the message content
4. If verification fails, the message is rejected with a security error

From the ``CommunicationHub``'s ``route_message`` method:

.. code-block:: python

    # This happens internally within the framework
    if not message.verify(sender.identity):
        logger.error(f"Message signature verification failed")
        raise SecurityError("Message signature verification failed")

This verification process guarantees that:

- The message truly came from the claimed sender
- The message hasn't been tampered with during transmission

Developers don't need to implement any verification logic themselves; AgentConnect handles this automatically.

Developer Responsibilities
------------------------

While AgentConnect handles most security concerns internally, developers should be aware of their responsibilities:

1. **Secure Identity Creation**: Always create unique identities for each agent using ``AgentIdentity.create_key_based()``

2. **Private Key Management**: If you need to persist agent identities across sessions, store the private keys securely:

   - Use secure secret management systems
   - Never hardcode private keys in source code
   - Consider environment variables or encrypted storage
   - Be careful about logging identity information

3. **Identity Assignment**: Always ensure each agent has its own identity when initializing:
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
       # CORRECT: Each agent gets its own identity
       agent1 = AIAgent(
           agent_id="agent1",
           identity=AgentIdentity.create_key_based(),
           # ... other parameters
       )
       
       agent2 = AIAgent(
           agent_id="agent2",
           identity=AgentIdentity.create_key_based(),
           # ... other parameters
       )

4. **Registry Trust**: The AgentRegistry maintains verified identities, so access to registry operations should be properly secured in production environments.

    While this guide covers the essentials of secure communication in AgentConnect, a more detailed guide exploring the cryptographic specifics, advanced security configurations, and best practices for production deployment is planned for the future.

    For most applications, the default security model provided by AgentConnect is sufficient, but organizations with specific security requirements may benefit from the upcoming detailed security documentation.

Summary
------

AgentConnect simplifies secure communication by automating the signing and verification of messages through the ``AgentIdentity`` system. By leveraging public key cryptography, the framework ensures:

- Messages are authentically from their claimed senders
- Message content remains unaltered during transmission
- Agent identities are uniquely verified

These mechanisms operate behind the scenes, allowing developers to focus on agent capabilities rather than security implementation details.
